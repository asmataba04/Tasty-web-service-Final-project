# Tasty-web-service-Final-project
Here is the final project of the Web Service course, entitled "Tasty." 
It consists of a RESTful API developed using Node.js, Express, JWT, HTML, EJS, and CSS, along with MySQL for managing the database. 
I have also used technologies such as Postman to test APIs, VSCode, and Git-Version to maximize the project’s quality. 
This project contains all the CRUD operations, secured with JWT bearer token authentication. 
This project aims to manage Tasty's customers' requests in order to provide them with a perfect environment in a secure and fast way. 
The principal idea behind this project is not only to increase Tasty's demand but mainly to save the customer's time and comfort in knowing what to order, where to order it, and how much time it will take. Tasty's system can also provide them with bills before they even leave home.
